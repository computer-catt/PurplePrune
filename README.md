# PurplePrune
a personal fork of NAAT with many fixes


This theme is designed to change the way Discord looks without any layout changes or excessive edits, Same reason people like the default Discord Nitro theme


# Important notes:
- Use Dark theme! turn sync off if you'd like to use another Discord theme on a different device.
- You need both ThemeConfig and PurplePrune active at the same time.
- Alternatively put the contents of [ThemeConfig.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/computer-catt/PurplePrune/main/ThemeConfig.css) in your QuickCSS to edit the background.

# History & Credit
This theme is mostly inspired from [VodkaXMartini's](https://github.com/VodkaXMartini) [PurpleGalaxy](https://github.com/VodkaXMartini/VendettaTheme/blob/main/PurpleGalaxy.json),

One day the background stopped working on my phone so i searched for the old one and found a [full wallpaper](https://imgur.com/oParsWN) of it on 4Chan, It wasn't animated but it looked very good.

I then made a beta version of this by just configuring [puckzxz's](https://github.com/puckzxz) [NAAT](https://github.com/puckzxz/NotAnotherAnimeTheme/blob/master/css/v3/naat.v3.css).

Some stuff was broken and i was messing with Discord CSS at the time anyway so i decided to fix it.

Then released my version of the theme(complying with Puckzxz's Unlicence licence)

Added [s-k-y-l-i's](https://github.com/s-k-y-l-i) [Transparent Popups](https://github.com/s-k-y-l-i/discord-themes/blob/main/Theme%20code/transparent-popups.css), Thank you!
