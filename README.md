# PurplePrune
a personal fork of naat with many fixes


this theme is designed to change the way discord looks without any layout changes or excessive edits, same reason people like the default discord nitro theme


note: designed for vencord, you need both themeconfig and purpleprune active at the same time
alternitavely put the contents of [themeconfig.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/computer-catt/PurplePrune/main/ThemeConfig.css) in your quickcss to edit the background
